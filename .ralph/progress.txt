=== Ralph Wiggum Progress Log ===
Project: Ralph Wiggum Technique - Enhancements
Started: 2026-01-07

--- Initial Setup ---
Created: 2026-01-07

Improvements Implemented (Manual):
1. ✅ Enhanced PRD Schema (v2.0)
   - Added type field (feature/bug/refactor/test)
   - Added depends_on array for feature dependencies
   - Added estimated_complexity field
   - Added iterations_taken tracking
   - Added blocked_reason for troubleshooting

2. ✅ Error Recovery & Rollback
   - Added ROLLBACK_ON_FAILURE configuration
   - Added VERIFY_BEFORE_COMPLETE configuration
   - Implemented automatic test running after commits
   - Implemented automatic rollback on test failures
   - Added rollback_last_commit function

3. ✅ Feature Type Support
   - Updated AGENT_PROMPT to understand feature types
   - Added type-specific implementation planning
   - Updated documentation with type examples

Files Updated:
- prd.json.template: Updated with new schema v2.0
- ralph.sh: Added error recovery and verification
- AGENT_PROMPT.md: Added dependency checking and type handling
- INITIALIZER_PROMPT.md: Documented new schema fields

Next Steps:
- Run Ralph on itself to implement remaining features (001-009)
- Start with feature 003 (enhanced test strategy) or 006 (config profiles) as they have no dependencies
- Use human-in-the-loop mode initially: ./ralph.sh
- Document progress after each feature completion

Total Features: 9
- High Priority: 4
- Medium Priority: 4
- Low Priority: 1

Features without dependencies (can start): 001, 002, 003, 005, 006, 007
Features with dependencies (do later): 004, 008, 009

Feature: 000 - Git Safety Checks
Status: Completed
Type: feature
Complexity: small

Implementation:
- Added PROTECTED_BRANCHES configuration (default: main,master)
- Added ALLOW_GIT_PUSH configuration (default: false)
- Implemented check_branch_safety() function
- Integrated branch check into check_prerequisites()
- Added helpful error messages when on protected branch
- Suggests creating feature branch with example command

Testing:
- Verified configuration variables are set correctly
- Checked error messaging is clear
- Confirmed branch check runs before any operations

Notes:
- This prevents Ralph from accidentally committing to main/master
- Git push is disabled by default for safety
- Users must explicitly enable push with ALLOW_GIT_PUSH=true
- Can override protected branches if needed (not recommended)
- Implemented manually to avoid Claude-in-Claude recursion

Next:
- All other features (001-009) now safe to implement
- Suggest starting with 006 (config profiles) or 007 (error handling)
- Can now safely use Ralph on itself!

Feature: Add git safety checks to prevent commits to main and accidental pushes
Status: Completed

Implementation:
- Added PROTECTED_BRANCHES configuration to ralph.sh (default: main,master)
- Added ALLOW_GIT_PUSH configuration to ralph.sh (default: false)
- Implemented is_protected_branch() function to check current branch
- Implemented suggest_feature_branch() function with helpful error messages
- Implemented check_for_git_push() function to detect unauthorized pushes
- Integrated branch protection check into check_prerequisites()
- Integrated push check into both single iteration and continuous loop
- Updated AGENT_PROMPT.md with git safety rules
- Updated README.md with comprehensive git safety documentation

Testing:
- Bash syntax validation passed (bash -n ralph.sh)
- Full integration testing skipped at user request

Key Files Modified:
- ralph.sh: Added git safety functions and checks (lines 15-19, 72-110, 226-241, 286-287, 352-353)
- AGENT_PROMPT.md: Added git safety rules to section 9 and DO NOT list
- README.md: Added "Git Safety Options" section with examples
- .ralph/prd.json: Marked feature 000 as complete, fixed circular dependency

Challenges:
- Initial circular dependency in prd.json (depends_on: ["000"]) was corrected to empty array
- Implementation was straightforward following the feature steps

Notes for next iteration:
- Feature 000 is now complete and all other features (001-009) depend on it
- Next features to consider: 001, 002, 003, 005, 006, 007 (all have dependencies met now)
- Recommended next: Feature 003 (Enhanced test strategy) or 006 (Config profiles) - both high/medium priority
- Git safety features are now active - Ralph will block operations on main/master by default

Feature: 010 - Enhance code quality checks: ensure linting, prettier, and TypeScript pass before completion
Status: Completed
Type: feature
Complexity: medium

Implementation:
- Updated AGENT_PROMPT.md section 6 with comprehensive Quality Gate Checklist
- Added CRITICAL quality gates section explaining formatting, linting, type checking, and test requirements
- Updated "DO" list to emphasize running ALL quality gates
- Updated "DO NOT" list to explicitly forbid marking features complete with failing checks
- Added AUTOFIX_PRETTIER configuration to ralph.sh (default: true)
- Completely rewrote run_verification_tests() function in ralph.sh with 4 quality gates:
  * Gate 1: Code Formatting (prettier/black/gofmt) - with auto-fix support
  * Gate 2: Linting (BLOCKING) - errors now block completion
  * Gate 3: Type Checking (BLOCKING) - TypeScript/mypy errors block completion  
  * Gate 4: Test Suite (BLOCKING) - test failures block completion
- Added clear error messages with emoji indicators (✅, ❌, ⊘)
- Added detailed quality gate summary display
- Added comprehensive "Code Quality Gates" section to README.md
- Documented all 4 gates with examples, configuration options, and troubleshooting

Testing:
- Bash syntax check passed: bash -n ralph.sh
- Verified AGENT_PROMPT.md changes are clear and actionable
- Verified README.md documentation is comprehensive

Key Files Modified:
- AGENT_PROMPT.md: Added quality gate checklist and critical rules (lines 154-193, 291-292, 301)
- ralph.sh: Added AUTOFIX_PRETTIER config (line 57), rewrote run_verification_tests() (lines 183-315)
- README.md: Added comprehensive quality gates documentation (lines 336-438)
- .ralph/prd.json: Marked feature 010 as complete with iterations_taken=1

Challenges:
- None - implementation was straightforward
- Changed AUTOFIX_PRETTIER default to true per user request

Notes for next iteration:
- Quality gates are now fully enforced
- All future features will be blocked if linting, type checking, or tests fail
- Features 001-009 are still available to implement
- Recommended next: Feature 003 (Enhanced test strategy) or 006 (Config profiles)
